 I am a little dog trying to learn how to use vim to seem cool.

please give me many treats. I am good dog.

I am a neolithic programming god that has learned nothing from my previous mistakes and I ought to learn the hard way about anything and everything. 



burh I am becoming god this is so much fun but I need to learn git first.




I am hubris itself commanded. I am have expereinced pride goeth before the fall far too many times but honestly when has that every stopped me.


I am doing my best to create my skill set as diversely as possible but also i write code very succintly.
